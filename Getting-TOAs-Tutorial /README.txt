This directory contains a tutorial for using our Checking Detections/Extraction of TOAs for pulsar timing. We keep the notebook at its most basic form, for efficiency of sifting through large amounts of data. 
List of files you need to run this notebook:
- Observation files (.fits files, etc) from the 20m telescope 
- A parameter file (.par) with updated values for the source (we obtain for the Crab through https://www.jb.man.ac.uk/pulsar/crab.html but you can also use the ATNF catalog)
- A template file (.bestprof). We picked one particularly bright source in the middle of our dataspan, and call it crabtemplate.bestprof
